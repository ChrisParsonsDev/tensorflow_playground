# TensorFlow Playground

Lots of cool [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) demos/general code snippets that may at some point be useful to me.

## Code Samples

1. [Softmax](./code/softmax.py) - Manual implementation of Softmax, the function that squashes logits from a network into probabilities.
2. [notMNIST](./code/notmnist.ipynb)

## Datasets

Working locally the datasets exist in the `./data` directory. To reduce the size of this repository I've added the contents of this folder to the `.gitignore` but you can find links to the data here..
